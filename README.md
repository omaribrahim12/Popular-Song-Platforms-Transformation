# Data Engineering Project: Analyzing Popular Songs Across Streaming Platforms

## Overview


This project explores the popularity trends of songs across three major streaming platforms from 1920 to 2020. By applying ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) concepts and data analysis techniques, we gain insights into how music preferences have evolved over the decades.
Project Components

### 1. Data Collection

Gathered data from three leading streaming platforms.

Collected metadata about the most popular songs, including release year, artist, and streaming statistics.

### 2. ETL Pipeline

Utilized Azure Data Lake Gen2 and Azure Data Factory for efficient data extraction, transformation, and loading processes.
Implemented Databricks for data processing and transformation tasks.

### 3. Data Analysis

Analyzed the collected data to identify trends in song popularity over time.
Employed Tableau for visualizing insights and trends derived from the data.

### Resources Used

Azure Data Lake Gen2: Storage solution for housing large volumes of streaming platform data.

Azure Data Factory: Orchestrated the ETL pipeline for seamless data movement.

Databricks: Leveraged for data processing and transformation tasks.

Tableau: Visualized insights and trends from the analyzed data.
